However, consulting notes from the class videos, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the lab problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course videos, the course textbooks, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
