However, consulting notes from the class videos, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the lab problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course videos, the course textbooks, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",

    "#### RGB Color Model:\n",
    "        \n",
    "Digital displays typically create colors by blending together\n",
    "    various amounts of red, green, and blue.  We can therefore\n",
    "    describe a color by putting its constituent amounts of red, green,\n",
    "    and blue into a vector $\\begin{bmatrix} R \\\\ G \\\\ B \\end{bmatrix}$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantities\n",
    "    $R$, $G$, and $B$ are each stored with one byte of\n",
    "    information so they are integers between 0 and 255.  This\n",
    "    is called the $RGB$ color model.\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "Run the cell below to create a function that takes the values of the RBG vector and outputs a rectangle with the corresponding color.  (The code in this function out of the scope of this course, but at a high level it utilizes matplotlib's `imshow` method, whic displays RBG data as an image (https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.html)"
