To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course videos, the course textbooks, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "Computer graphics essentially consist of a large number of basic geometric shapes such as triangles or quadrilaterals, defined by their vertexes (corners).  The ability to manipulate these shapes efficiently is a fundamental necessity in the field of computer graphics.  Linear transformations can be used to generate complex shapes from basic shapes through effects such as shearing and reflection, and can also be used to rotate and translate shapes in order to create a sequence of images needed for an animated scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software responsible for rendering three-dimensional scenes in modern video games must process the coordinates of millions of vertexes in each frame of animation.  Typical hardware used for running the software will be able to generate around 60 frames per second.  In addition to the placement of vertexes in a scene, there are other computations required, such as those to provide color and shading, and then to project the three-dimensional scene onto the two-dimensional screen.  In this context, the efficiency of the algorithms, software, and hardware all play a major role in the quality of the end result.  \n",

    "The use of matrix multiplication to manipulate coordinates for computer graphics has two primary advantages.  Matrix representations can be used to merge multiple transformations together into a single transformation.  For example, instead of applying a rotation followed by a scaling transformation, the two operations can easily be merged into a single operation by multiplying the associated matrices as we did earlier.  The other advantage to organizing the calculations into matrix multiplications is that dedicated hardware (graphics processing units) is designed specifically to handle these calculations in large numbers.\n",
